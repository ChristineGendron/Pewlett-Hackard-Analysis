# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

This analysis is meant to help a company ("Pewlett Hackard") maintain business continuity as a large number of their employees reach retirement age. Specifically, we're determining whether instituting a program to mentor new-hires is a viable solution to looming staffing shortages.

## Results:

- 1,549 Employees are eligible for the mentorship program the company is considering, in which they would step away from their current positions into a part-time role as mentors to newly-hired employees.
- Many more employees with "Senior" positions are retiring than employees with non-senior positions. (70.17% of retiring employees are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff.)
- More employees with non-senior roles are eligible for the mentorship program. Only 45.51% of potential mentors are Senior Engineers or Senior Staff.
- Only 2 employees with the title "Manager" are eligible to retire.

## Summary:

- 72,458 roles will need to be filled as eligible workers retire in the upcoming "silver tsunami".

- There are 1,549 potential mentors. As you can see from the charts below, these employees are not proportionarely divided across the positions with the most retirees. For example, 65 Assistant Engineers will be mentoring new employees filling 1,090 vacant Assistant Engineer Roles, while 253 mentors will be responsible for mentoring new hires in 25,916 Senior Engineer roles. This program alone will not be enough to prepare the company for the coming years.
